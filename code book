##Explanation regarding the attributes in the data set.

The dataset is then divided in two parts and they can be used separately.

1. Inertial sensor data
- Raw triaxial signals from the accelerometer and gyroscope of all the trials with with participants.
- The labels of all the performed activities.

2. Records of activity windows. Each one composed of:
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- Its associated activity label.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.


Include all the activity labels available for the dataset (1 per row).
Column 1: experiment number ID,
Column 2: user number ID,
Column 3: activity number ID
Column 4: Label start point (in number of signal log samples (recorded at 50Hz))
Column 5: Label end point (in number of signal log samples)

- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the 'X' and 'y' files.
- The units used for the accelerations (total and body) are 'g's (gravity of earth -> 9.80665 m/seg2).
- The gyroscope units are rad/seg.
